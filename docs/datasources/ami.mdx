# Amazon AMI Data Source

Type: `amazon-ami`

The Amazon AMI data source will filter and fetch an Amazon AMI, and output all the AMI information that will
be then available to use in the [Amazon builders](/docs/builders/amazon).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "amazon-ami" "basic-example" {
    filters = {
        virtualization-type = "hvm"
        name = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"
        root-device-type = "ebs"
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]
    most_recent = true
}
```
This selects the most recent Ubuntu 16.04 HVM EBS AMI from Canonical. Note that the data source will fail unless
*exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

### How to use this plugin

From Packer v1.7.0, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration to install this plugin.
Then, run [`packer init`](/docs/commands/init).

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      version = ">= 0.0.1"
      source = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

- `filters` (map[string]string) - Filters used to select an AMI. Any filter described in the docs for
[DescribeImages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html)
is valid.

- `owners` ([]string) - Filters the images by their owner. You
may specify one or more AWS account IDs, "self" (which will use the
account whose credentials you are using to run Packer), or an AWS owner
alias: for example, `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, or `microsoft`. This
option is required for security reasons.

- `most_recent` (bool) - Selects the newest created image when true.
This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.

## Output Data

- `id` (string) - The ID of the AMI.

- `name` (string) - The name of the AMI.

- `creation_date` (string) - The date of creation of the AMI.

- `owner` (string) - The AWS account ID of the owner.

- `owner_name` (string) - The owner alias.

- `tags` (map[string]string) - The key/value combination of the tags assigned to the AMI.

## Authentication

The Amazon Data Sources authentication works just like for the [Amazon Builders](/docs/builders/amazon). Both
have the same authentication options, and you can refer to the [Amazon Builders authentication](/docs/builders/amazon#authentication)
to learn the options to authenticate for data sources.

-> **Note:** A data source will start and execute in your own authentication session. The authentication in the data source
doesn't relate with the authentication on Amazon Builders.

Basic example of an Amazon data source authentication using `assume_role`:

```hcl
data "amazon-secretsmanager" "basic-example" {
  name = "packer_test_secret"
  key  = "packer_test_key"

  assume_role {
      role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
      session_name = "SESSION_NAME"
      external_id  = "EXTERNAL_ID"
  }
}
```
