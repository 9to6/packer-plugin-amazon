# Amazon Data Sources

The Amazon plugin is able to fetch data from AWS. To achieve this, the plugin comes with data sources to retrieve AMI and secrets information.
Packer supports the following data sources at the moment:

- [amazon-ami](/docs/datasources/amazon/ami) - Filter and fetch an Amazon AMI to output all the AMI information.

- [amazon-secretsmanager](/docs/datasources/amazon/secretsmanager) - Retrieve information
about a Secrets Manager secret version, including its secret value.

## How to use this plugin

From Packer v1.7.0, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration to install this plugin.
Then, run [`packer init`](/docs/commands/init).

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      version = ">= 0.0.1"
      source = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The Amazon Data Sources authentication works just like for the [Amazon Builders](/docs/builders/amazon). Both
have the same authentication options, and you can refer to the [Amazon Builders authentication](/docs/builders/amazon#authentication)
to learn the options to authenticate for data sources.

-> **Note:** A data source will start and execute in your own authentication session. The authentication in the data source
doesn't relate with the authentication on Amazon Builders.

Basic example of an Amazon data source authentication using `assume_role`:

```hcl
data "amazon-secretsmanager" "basic-example" {
  name = "packer_test_secret"
  key  = "packer_test_key"

  assume_role {
      role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
      session_name = "SESSION_NAME"
      external_id  = "EXTERNAL_ID"
  }
}
```
